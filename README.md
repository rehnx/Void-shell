# VoidShell

Phase 1 is a deliberately small Arch Linux shell foundation built on Hyprland,
Quickshell, and QML. It contains compositor defaults, essential keybindings,
wallpaper startup, and an empty Quickshell root. UI components are outside this
phase.

## Dependencies

Install these Arch packages (an AUR helper may be needed for Quickshell):

- `hyprland`
- `quickshell`
- `swaybg`
- `kitty`

## Install

```sh
./scripts/check-dependencies.sh
./install.sh
```

The installer honors `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` and `XDG_STATE_HOME`, defaulting to
`~/.config` and `~/.local/state`. Managed files are installed under
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/hypr` and `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/rehanshell/shell`.

Changed destination files are backed up below
`$XDG_STATE_HOME/rehanshell/backups` before replacement. Re-running the
installer leaves identical files alone. Existing `hypr/user.conf` is always
preserved; put monitor, input, and other machine-specific overrides there.

Start Hyprland normally. It starts the solid-color wallpaper and the
`rehanshell` Quickshell configuration once per session.
